# [PORTIA BALOYI]'s Project

## PORSCHECAST APP

Creating a podcast app, that allows me to create a space where interesting shows are just a click away, with a sleek interface powered by React. Whether the user is into adventure, history or animation, the porschecast app has it all. The user should be ready to tune in and turn up their volume.
